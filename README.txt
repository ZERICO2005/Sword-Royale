Sword-Royale was a Clash Royale clone I made for a computer science project in high school.

The user places down different cards from their deck to destroy the other castle. Better cards are more expensive and require more gold. To play, click a card from the deck, move it somewhere on your side of the field, and click again to place it (given you have enough gold).

To import the project into Eclispe, make a new "Java Project" and name it to "Sword-Royale". Afterwards, copy the images and src folder into the project folder in File Explorer. Refresh Eclispe through File --> Refresh, then select Main.java and run the game.

This version of the code is from 2023, June 6th.
